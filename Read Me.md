Optimization of Composite Materials with Machine Learning
This repository contains a sample project that demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to optimize the properties of composite materials. The project includes a simple Python code that uses supervised learning to predict material properties, such as tensile strength, based on various input parameters.

Project Overview
Composite materials, which combine different components to achieve superior performance, are widely used in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and construction. Optimizing these materials involves finding the best combination of parameters (e.g., fiber content, matrix type) to maximize desired properties like strength, stiffness, and durability.

This project explores the use of machine learning, particularly supervised learning techniques, to develop predictive models that can assist in this optimization process.

Objectives
Develop predictive models to forecast material properties like tensile strength based on input parameters.
Optimize composite material properties using machine learning techniques to balance multiple objectives such as strength, weight, and cost.
Integrate multiscale modeling to analyze composite materials at both microscopic and macroscopic levels.
Validate the effectiveness of various machine learning approaches for optimizing composite material designs.
Enhance efficiency and reliability in the composite material development process through data-driven strategies.
